// thought process: create a function that takes an email as an argument, use regex to check if the email ends with @gmail.com and contains only alphanumeric characters before the @ symbol, return a message based on the validation result.
const emailValidation =(email)=>{
    const regEx =/^[a-zA-Z0-9]*@gmail.com$/
const emaiCheck = regEx.test(email)
return emaiCheck === true ? "email saved" : "sorry your email don't meet standards"
}
console.log(emailValidation("iryeiryur@gmail.com"));
